            Tiny, multilingual Switzerland packs a lot into its landlocked
            borders: glittering lakes, sky-high peaks, postcard-perfect
            villages, world-class museums. Get a taste of it all with the Grand
            Tour, a 1,000-mile route that takes you to the medieval old city of
            Bern, towering Jungfraujoch, the iconic Matterhorn, and 42 other
            must-sees. Or choose your own fondue-fuelled adventure: Ski bunnies
            and adrenaline junkies can hit the slopes at Graubünden or Verbier;
            urban explorers can sample Zurich’s burgeoning food scene or take in
            art at Basel’s Kunstmuseum. Or just sit back, relax, and breathe in
            the fresh alpine air at one of Switzerland’s luxurious spa resorts.
